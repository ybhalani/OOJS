<h1>Promise & Deferred</h1>
<p>promises in js give us the ability to write asynchronous code in a parallel manner to synchronous code</p>
<p>a promise represents a value that is not yet known</p>
<p>a deferred represents work that is not yet finished</p>
<p>A promise is a placeholder for a result which is initially unknown while a deferred represents the computation that results in the value.
    Every deferred has a promise which functions as a proxy for the future result.
    While a promise is a value returned by an asynchronous function,
    a deferred can be resolved or rejected by itâ€™s caller which separates the promise from the resolver.
    The promise itself can be given to any number of consumers and each will observe the resolution independently
    meanwhile the resolver / deferred can be given to any number of producers and the promise will be resolved by the one that first resolves it.
    From a semantic perspective this means that instead of calling a function ( callback ),
    we are able to return a value ( promise ).</p>
